We have to create the guidelines and rules that we \nwant to follow, and those rules are called the by-laws. These by-laws must \nrespect the limits that the law places on community organizations and the \nfounding objectives laid out in the letters patent. \nThese rules help to ensure that all members are treated fairly and give us a \nkind of roadmap about the way the organization works. For example, by-laws \nshould lay out who is considered to be a member of the organization and \nhow decisions are made. Good by-laws help to prevent uncertainty and \ninconsistency and promote transparency. They provide an important \nframework for how the board of directors can help the organization to fulfill \nits mission. \nHealthy by-laws for a healthy organization\nBy-laws should be written in plain language and avoid jargon. Having clear \nwording is important to avoid ambiguity in what a given by-law was meant to \nsay. Keeping paragraphs short and sweet is important! Using the same key \nterms repeatedly throughout the by-laws can be important for clarity and \nconsistency. It is also important to define key terms at the beginning of the \nby-laws. Organizing the by-laws with titles and subtitles can help to make \nthem user-friendly. We can help to ensure that our by-laws don't leave \npeople out by using gender-inclusive language (for example, using the plural \npronoun they instead of the singular he or she). It is important to have \nmultiple people involved in writing and reviewing the by-laws for clarity, \ncoherence and to be sure they fit with the mandate.\nPUBLISHED 2010\nBecause we are not lawyers at COCo, our info-sheets only present general information.

Having a common \ninterpretation of what the by-laws mean can help to prevent \nmisunderstandings and conflicts as we work together for social change. It is \nimportant for staff and board members to have all read the by-laws, and \nhave them guide the internal processes that we use. \nWhen are by-laws created?\nThe original by-laws are created when the organization is founded. However, \nas a group grows and changes, the by-laws may need to be modified too.\nWhen do we make changes to the by-laws or our letters \npatent?\nIn Quebec, Annual General Meetings (AGM) and Special General Meetings \n(SGM) are the places where proposed constitutional or by-law changes \nprepared by the board of directors can be accepted or rejected by a vote of \nthe members attending the a general meeting. If there is no AGM coming up, \nwe can call a SGM to make changes happen more quickly.
