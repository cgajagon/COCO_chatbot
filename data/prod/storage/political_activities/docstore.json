When discussing social policy, charities have a real expertise about the issues on \nwhich they work and want to share this information with government bodies and the general public. \nIn order to share their knowledge and experience without losing their charitable status, charities want to \nknow \nwhat is considered a political activity, what kind of political activities are allowed, and how \nmany of these activities they can organize or participate in each year. Organizations that are considering \napplying for charitable status also want to understand the rules about political activities so they can decide \nif registering as a charity is right for their organization.\nThis info-sheet provides an introduction to the rules on political activities for charities. It also references the \ncriticisms raised about the political activity rules, and provides an update on the CRA's political activities \naudit of charities and recent government consultations on the political activity rules. \nPlease contact COCo for more detailed information or for references to lawyers with experiences working \nwith registered charities.\nThe information presented below provides, in part, a summary of the CRA \u2019s policy statement on political \nactivities and all quotations originate from that document.

What is the difference between incorporating as\na non-profit organization and applying for charitable \nstatus?\nA non-profit organization is not necessarily a charity. Incorporation is a separate process from applying \nfor charitable status, and in fact, many non-profit organizations are incorporated but are not registered as \ncharities. Organizations can incorporate federally or provincially, with the choice often depending on a\nvariety of factors. For more information about incorporation, please refer to:\nCOCo Info-Sheet\n\u201cIncorporation of a Non-Profit Organization in Quebec\u201d\nRegistering as a charity is separate process that is administered by the CRA. For more information on \napplying for charitable status, please refer to:\nCOCo Info-Sheet\n\u201c Applying for Charitable Status\u201d\n2. What are some of the benefits of being a registered \ncharity?\nRegistered charities do not have to pay income tax and benefit from some preferential treatment with the \nGST and QST.\nRegistered charities can provide official receipts for donations, which entitle the donors to gain certain tax \nbenefits in exchange for their donations.\nRegistered charities are also eligible to receive funds from charitable private and public foundations.\nMore generally, charities must follow certain financial and governance obligations and ensure that they devote \ntheir resources to their charitable purposes and activities.

What is the general rule about charities and political \nactivities?\nA charity can only carry out political activities if it complies with certain legal limits. The activities have to be \nnon-partisan, connected to a charity's charitable purpose, and can only use a limited percentage of the char-\nity's resources. Failure to comply with these rules can have serious consequences, including the suspension \nof a charity's right to issue tax receipts and even revocation of its charitable status.\nDepending on the size of the organization, only 10% to 20% of a charity's resources can be spent on non-par-\ntisan political activities. This is often referred to as \u201cthe 10% Rule\u201d although the percentage varies according \nto the income of the organization. \nFor the amount that applies to your organization, consult the \"Expenditures\" section of the CRA Policy \nstatement found here:  \n http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/plcy/cps/cps- 022-eng.html\nAllowable (non-partisan) political activities include things like calling on the public to put pressure on the \ngovernment to change a law or policy.\nA charity can never endorse or oppose a political party or candidate at any government level. Partisan \npolitical activities are prohibited activities.\nNote that some activities that might at first seem to be political might actually be\nconsidered charitable activities. \nFor example, some public awareness raising activities might be accepted as char -\nitable activities when they are well-reasoned, non-partisan, and sufficiently related \nand subordinate to the charity's purposes. Such activities would then not count to -\nwards the maximum number of political activities.\n!\nIn addition to the resources from the CRA already mentioned in this document, Imagine Canada has a \nuseful summary of the the political activity rules here:\nImagine Canada\n\"Political Activities\"\nhttp://sectorsource.ca/managing-organization/activities/political- activities", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1958, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c53aad4-ab07-4f54-84d1-41a1cb30e984": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c53aad4-ab07-4f54-84d1-41a1cb30e984", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b795da0-41b8-48fc-9fab-ac594ec2db16", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "e08b0b40be73488db0effd38b36b7ad08b6aa5c1c9423b69c0307cef27756ab0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "5\nAre all types of political activities allowed?\nNo, only non-partisan political activities are allowed.

Partisan po-\nlitical activities are prohibited activities.

If one candidate is given more \ntime to speak, this may be interpreted as partisan political activity, and is there -\nfore prohibited.\nFor example:\nThe WolfRat Dancing Collective is concerned about recent legislation that limits\nfunding for the arts. The WolfRat Dancing Collective can make the voting records\nof all elected officials available via a link on their website but, in order to avoid \nappearing partisan, they cannot point to the specific voting history of any candi-\ndate or party.\nFor more detailed information about partisan political activities, please see:\nCRA Advisory\n\u201cImportant Advisory on Partisan Political Activities\u201d\nhttp://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts- gvng/chrts/cmmnctn/pltcl-ctvts/dvsry- eng.html", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1667, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9cab68c-c7ec-4205-ba21-5be851b68824": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9cab68c-c7ec-4205-ba21-5be851b68824", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "350dc274-7b7d-4357-ad6d-704f93e1422d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "cdd14ef17b06f4e0ab3befbb20168da05777d1d910c9f4f2431c28a60610e25b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "6\nWhat if an organization takes the same position as a political party or\ncandidate?\nA charity can still take a similar position as a political party or candidate, as long as the charity does not \nendorse, mention, or connect one of their ideas or proposed policy changes with any political party or can-\ndidate.\n4. What are non-partisan political activities?\nThe Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) defines non-partisan activities as anything that explicitly calls for \na \u201claw, policy or decision of any level of government\u201d to be \u201cretained, opposed or changed\u201d. Non-partisan \npolitical activities are the only type of political activities charities can organize or participate in. It is these \ntypes of activities that the CRA defines as falling within the yearly limitations on political activities.\nNon-partisan political activities can include asking people to contact politicians, communicating with the \npublic at large, and delivering an opinion in any of the organization\u2019s materials. The policy\u2019s mention of \u201cany \nlevel of government\u201d refers to governments both within Canada and in any foreign country.\nFor example:\nQueer Youth United, a registered charity based in Montreal, is very upset that their main funder, Quebec\u2019s \nMinistry of Health and Social Services, has cut 12 million dollars in core funding for youth organizations\npursuant to the recent economic downturn. The charity is worried that this will greatly reduce the funding \nreceived by all youth organizations, including their own, next year.\nQueer Youth United wants to call on their members, other groups that are impacted by the funding cuts, \nand the public at large to phone, email and fax the Minister of Health and Social Services demanding that \nthe funding be reinstated in full. This would be considered non-partisan political activity by the Canada\nRevenue Agency. Any staff, financial or other resources that Queer Youth United puts into this project will \ncount towards the charity\u2019s yearly limits on political activity.\nIt is important to note, however, that some advocacy activities that may seem like non-partisan political \nactivities will not count towards an organization\u2019s yearly limit if certain criteria are met, as described in the \nnext section.\nNote: any non-partisan political activities that a charity undertakes need to \nrelate to the charity\u2019s mandate and should be well-reasoned.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2377, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fa07ca7-dc4e-4a1c-9c90-80dc056a84c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fa07ca7-dc4e-4a1c-9c90-80dc056a84c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67f00003-a3a4-485f-8a06-d39ed7afb8b0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "ad5f83e4871a775052c60fd85af079d73b3c7229df088e95d467aef0c63b1b91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7\n5. What advocacy activities are not considered political \nactivities by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)?\nThere are various advocacy activities that a charity may assume are political, which the CRA will not in fact \ncount towards the charity\u2019s yearly limitations since they are considered to be charitable activities. \nThese include:\n\u2022 Public awareness campaigns well-reasoned and not based on false or inaccurate information. The \nCRA defines a well-reasoned position as one \u201cbased on factual information that is methodically, objec-\ntively, fully, and fairly analyzed. Awareness campaigns should be about issues that fall within a charity's \nmandate. \n\u2022 Making a statements or representation to government and elected politicians, even if the charity is \ntalking about changing, keeping or stopping a law, government policy or decision. Again, the informa-\ntion presented must be \u201cwell-reasoned\u201d and within the charity\u2019s mandate.\n\u2022 Publishing or distributing the text from a representation to elected officials either on the Internet or \nin the form of a press release, is not considered political activity as long as you don\u2019t ask the reader to \ncontact the government or elected politician to demand that they change, keep or change a law, gov-\nernment policy or decision.\nHow does the Canada Revenue Agency know how many political activities\nmy charity organized or participated in each year?\nIt is a charity\u2019s responsibility to report their political activities on the yearly Registered Charity Information \nReturn. This form must be submitted by a charity every year. The charity needs to report on the political\nactivities it carried out and how those activities relate to the charities' charitable purposes. It also needs to \nreport on the the physical and human resources used in carry out those activities.\nFor any foreign funding that was received with instructions that it be use for political activities, specific \nreporting information is required.\nCRA Charity Information Return\n\u201cT3010 Registered Charity Information Return\u201d\nhttp://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t3010/\nOr you can contact the Canada Revenue Agency for more information by phone at 1-800- 267-2384 \n(English) or 1-888- 892-5667 (bilingual).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2220, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf7573bd-cbc4-4432-bc0d-2ecb56746df9": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf7573bd-cbc4-4432-bc0d-2ecb56746df9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4fe0049d-0d78-4484-a5ee-51ecdbbcef84", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "16fd2146f1ddd445985fad027ed0370a9152e3b4475c85b742f4cdc986692848", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "8\n**Note that in 2012, certain reporting and compliance requirements changed regarding charities and politi-\ncal activities.

Other concerns focused on the overall structure of \ncharity law, arguing that the current framework for eligibility is too restrictive and imposes unnecessary \nlimitations on charities that are already registered and the ability of registered charities to contribute to a \nvibrant democratic state.\nThe CRA \u2019s political activities policy statement attempts to address some of the concerns raised by the \n\u201cVoluntary Sector Initiative\u201d, as well as the Charities and Democracy project and the Ontario Council of \nAgencies Serving Immigrants (OCASI).\nAfter considerable pressure from coalitions and organizations, the CRA released a policy statement on \ncharitable status applications from organizations working with ethnocultural communities, which outlines \nwhich activities will be deemed charitable.\nThe policy statement can be found at:\nCRA Policy Statement\n\u201cCharitable Work and Ethnocultural Groups: Information on registering as a charity\u201d\nhttp://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/chrts/plcy/thn- eng.html", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2255, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "755af9d1-3cf5-4724-b632-7b92e43086c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "755af9d1-3cf5-4724-b632-7b92e43086c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6a8c414a-738d-44a3-8aa4-0dafb455c3d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\Political-Activities-Aug-2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 147985, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "ab22cf021be61cefc2dc940da9e5e0b84ab53921559e97404c749634f12c426c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "9\nThe CRA also released guidelines about charities upholding human rights, see:\n\"Upholding Human Rights and Charitable Registration\"\nhttp://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts- gvng/chrts/plcy/cgd/hmn-rghts- eng.html\nMost recently, the political activities rules have been widely discussed in the media and in the charity and \nnon-profit sector due to the CRA's political activities audit.\nCOCo provided an update about the audit, and the announcement that it was winding down here:\n\"End of the Political Activities Audit: What Does it Mean for Charities?\"\nhttp://coco-net.org/political- activities-audit/\nWhat about the Consultation on Political Activities?\nIn 2016, the Canadian government announced a consultation on political activities.
