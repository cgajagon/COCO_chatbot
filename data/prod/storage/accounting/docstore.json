For every transaction an \naccount is debited and another is credited.  To balance, the total of all debits must equal \nthe total of all credits.\n4) Have a chart of accounts that tracks your all of your organization\u2019s financial \ntransactions.  It should encompass what board and staff, the public, and funding bodies \nneed to know.  It should include a) program and core income and expenses; b) budget \nline items (categories and sub-categories of your expenses and revenues) that need to \nbe shown; c) grants and contracts that require detailed financial reports; d) whether \ndonations are unrestricted net assets (have no donor restrictions for their use), or \ntemporarily or permanently restricted net assets; and e) a numbering of all accounts.\n5) Produce a statement of activities (all income and expenses, their source, and surplus or \ndeficit within the fiscal period) and a statement of position (or balance sheet:  what the \norganization owns, what it owes and what it is worth) on a regular basis.\n6) Have a consistent bookkeeping system that standardizes when you, for example, enter \ndata, summarize data, reconcile data, and close the books.\n7) Highlight an expense paid in advance at the year-end and record it as an asset.\nPUBLISHED MARCH 2009\nBecause we are not lawyers at COCo, our info-sheets only present general information.

The depreciation based on the estimated useful life using different \nmethods and rates is considered an expenditure.\n10) Comply with government regulations including source deductions and employee \nremittances, charitable status rules, tax filings, etc.\n11) Have internal controls such as a budget, the segregation of financial duties (no one \nperson should control all aspects of a financial transaction- logging entries, making \ndeposits and reviewing bank statements), policies for purchasing and travel, procedures \nfor processing deposits and expenses.\n12) Take petty cash from a petty cash fund (not \u2018cash on hand\u2019) which should be for short \nterm use, carefully controlled, and managed by at least two people.\n13) Do not loan money to staff or board members.\nSource\n\u201cBookkeeping basics: What every nonprofit bookkeeper needs to know\u201d\nRuegg, D.L., Venkatrathnam, L.M.
