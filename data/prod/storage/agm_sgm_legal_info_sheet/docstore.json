covers:\nAnnual General Meetings and Special \nGeneral Meetings  \nCOCo Legal Info-sheet\nPublished 07/10, Updated 07/12 and 05/18\n1  Why we hold general meetings \nOne reason that non-profits hold meetings with their membership is because the law says they are obligated \nto do so. This info-sheet was made to explain key legal requirements for these meetings.\nAs important as those legal responsibilities are, it\u2019s vital to avoid thinking about these meetings purely in \nterms of the law, or your meetings are sure to feel like a stressful chore. Meetings with our membership are  \na very important place to strengthen the democratic life of our organization, and strengthen the ability of our \ncommunity to work together for social change. They are a place where we can give our membership a real \nsay in major decisions that are being made about the structure, direction and governance of the organization.  \nCOCo believes that we should invest in ensuring that our meetings are spaces for community groups to \nfoster and sustain relationships, provide space for self-reflection and critique, and build collective power: in \nshort, to support the democratic life of social movements and community groups! \nFor more information on strategies about how to do this, see the resources listed at the end of this info-\nsheet, especially those produced by the Comit\u00e9 sectoriel de main-d\u2019\u0153uvre (CSMO), as well as our article \n\u201cHow to Make Your AGM Great, Not Just Necessary\u201d \n1\n2\n3\n4\n7\n7\n9\n11\n12\n12\n15\n17\n1  Why we hold general meetings................................................................................................\n2  Finding the rules that apply to you..........................................................................................\n3  When to have your Annual General Meeting (AGM) .............................................................\n4  When to have a Special General Meeting (SGM)...................................................................\n5  Where to hold your meeting.....................................................................................................\n6  Setting the agenda....................................................................................................................\n7  Giving notice of the meeting.....................................................................................................\n8  Quorum.....................................................................................................................................\n9  Minutes......................................................................................................................................\n10  Meeting Procedure..................................................................................................................\n11  Presenting financial statements..............................................................................................\n12  Board elections........................................................................................................................", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3093, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7814882a-c3bb-4fa1-bf44-d1ddbccb3afd": {"__data__": {"id_": "7814882a-c3bb-4fa1-bf44-d1ddbccb3afd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "78bd748a-999f-48d8-9c4a-4149f564fdc3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "cfb06b29673d271833f495c9d5e3d45f5aea1e5a90d518d6af07a064183d66f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2\n2  Finding the rules that apply to you\nTo use this info-sheet, you will need to know whether your non-profit is provincially incorporated in Quebec \n(under Part III of Quebec\u2019s Companies Act ) or federally incorporated (under the Canada Not-for-Profit \nCorporations Act). For more information on types of non-profits , see COCo\u2019S info-sheet on  Incorporation \nof a Non-Profit in Quebec. \nThe other important set of rules that apply to you are the rules set out in your organization\u2019s \nconstitution and its by-laws. \nThis information sheet uses \u201cconstitution\u201d to mean the document that was issued by the government to \ncertify your organization\u2019s creation. The constitution is often likened to the organization\u2019s \u201cbirth certificate\u201d. \nThe technical name for your constitution is either letters patent, if you are a provincially incorporated non-\nprofit under the Quebec Companies Act; or  articles of incorporation , if you are a federally incorporated \nnon-profit.\nYour constitution sets out some basic rules for your organization including its name, its purpose, and the \nlocation of its office. It may also contain rules that affect how you run your general meetings.\nSamples of valid by-laws for provincially incorporated organizations can be found in the resources listed \nat the end, including Votre association (at pages 84 and following) and the Bo\u00eete \u00e0 outils,  2016 (in the \nappendices referenced by Module 1). \nFor federally incorporated organizations, Corporations Canada offers model by-laws and a by-laws builder \ntool on its website; we have included the link to that in the appendix. It is best to adapt these samples to the \nneeds, spirit, and practices of your own organization, so long as they remain consistent with the contents of \nyour constitution and the law.. Examples of rules that non-profits commonly adopt in their by-laws are also \nprovided throughout this info-sheet, for example:\n Organizations who aim to ensure their decisions are made by the people directly impacted by their \n work or who aim to foster leadership within their constituencies will sometimes adopt by-laws \n requiring that a given proportion of its directors have participated in the organization\u2019s activities.\nOne level below the constitution is your non-profit's by-laws which are internal rules your or -\nganization makes for itself about how it operates. By-laws often describe rules that must be \nfollowed for membership meetings, board elections, and board meetings. By-laws are different \nfrom organizational policies, which tend to address day-to-day issues like hiring, sick- and va -\ncation-time, and purchasing. Changes to your by-laws must be approved by your membership, \nwhile policies can simply be adopted by the board or staff. For by-laws to be binding, they have \nto comply with your constitution and with the law under which you are incorporated.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2868, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e14b08a3-8b15-4ab0-a754-aa430af9b9c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "e14b08a3-8b15-4ab0-a754-aa430af9b9c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bfec5286-3510-4c84-a93f-f0a8f0a24b56", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "aa2944ea8c30599d38ac57b7ac372a7727cd7008bd313362ad9940af58e148c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "3\n3  When to have your Annual General Meeting (AGM)\nIf you are provincially incorporated...  \nProvincially incorporated non-profits must hold their Annual General Meeting each year at a time allowed \nby your letters patent and your by-laws. If none is set, your AGM must be held on the fourth Wednesday in \nJanuary at their head office.\n It\u2019s common for the by-laws of provincially incorporated non-profits to provide that their AGM must \nbe held within four months of the end of the organization\u2019s financial year. This allows flexibility in timing your \nAGM, and also makes it easier to satisfy the legal requirement that financial statements presented at the \nAGM must have been approved within the last four months. See below in Section 11 \n                 -- Presenting financial statements for more information. \n?\nWhat is a Fiscal year? \nA fiscal (or financial) year, is the year an organization uses to budget its \nspending and income. Fiscal years are not the same from organization to \norganization. At COCo, many non-profits that we work with have fiscal years \nthat run either from January 1st to December 31st, or April 1st to March 31st.\n!\nSome organizations have a fixed date in their by-laws for their AGM.\n For example, an organization could state that their AGM will be held  \n on March 2nd of every year, so long as this was within four months of  \n the end of their fiscal year. \nSome organizations do not have a fixed date in their bylaws, but their \nbylaws say approximately when their AGM will be held: \n For example, an organization could state in their bylaws that their   \n AGM occurs between the third week of February and the third week \n of March, so long as this was within four months of the end of their  \n fiscal year.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1751, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4d1d612-114a-4914-a5c8-43e18a601a9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4d1d612-114a-4914-a5c8-43e18a601a9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00522413-d4bf-4c3b-879d-ddb1698774ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "e6d9d60346142ee413101d40b779384b6b1532f43761ee6de32d7265cae0e791", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "4\nIf you are federally incorporated...  \nThe federal non-profit law\u2019s name for an AGM is the annual meeting of members.

It\u2019s good prac-\ntice to regularly update your membership contact lists to be able to notify your members.\nProvincially incorporated non-profits commonly establish in their by-laws that accidentally \nfailing to give notice to a member doesn\u2019t invalidate a general meeting.\nMembers who weren\u2019t properly notified can renounce notice, and are presumed to have renounced it if they \nare present at the general meeting, unless they raise an objection. By renouncing their right to proper notice, \nmembers can allow a general meeting to be held without any delay and without the board providing any no-\ntice, for example, as long as all the members with the power to vote renounce this right. By-laws sometimes \nexplicitly state that notice can be renounced.\n7.1  If you are provincially incorporated...\nWhen must you give notice? \nIf your by-laws don\u2019t specify a timeframe, provincially incorporated organizations \nhave to give notice ten days before a general meeting.\nThe delay is calculated starting from the time the notice is received (or would nor-\nmally be expected to be received), and by default is counted in \u201cclear days\u201d: neither \nthe day that notice is received nor the day that the meeting is held count toward the \ntotal. To reduce confusion, your by-laws can explicitly state what the notice delay is.\nWhat must you include in the notice? \nNotice must include the time, place and nature of the meeting (i.e. \u201cannual general \nmeeting\u201d, \u201cspecial general meeting\u201d, or \u201cannual and special general meeting\u201d). Notice \nof an SGM must clearly list each topic to be discussed, and it is standard to also do \nso when giving notice of an AGM.\nHow must you give notice? \nBy default, notice must be sent by registered mail to each member\u2019s last known ad-\ndress and must be advertised in a newspaper published in English and one in French \nin the nearest place to the company\u2019s head office where such newspapers exist (or in \nonly one newspaper if they don\u2019t exist in both languages in that place).\nLetters patent or by-laws for provincially incorporated organizations may provide a \nless onerous method to give notice than using registered mail or newspaper advertise-\nments.\nBe careful with these seemingly simpler methods of giving notice. A television ad-\nvertisement alone is not valid notice. Similarly, simply putting up a poster in the head \noffice a few days in advance of the meeting may be not only unfair to the membership, \nbut also potentially invalid because it fails to effectively reach the membership.\n?\n!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2650, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b6802a0-9c83-447b-837e-4f20f5d6e3c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b6802a0-9c83-447b-837e-4f20f5d6e3c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "234c15ec-9ce9-4acd-932d-61b8ceb9e219", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "395f1bd50ebe3e5c62bafaed33b0b417cf778d8bad2d1ba1f76c74abf284a922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "10\n7.2  If you are federally incorporated...\nWhen and how must you give notice?

Without quorum, the entire gen-\neral meeting is invalid, although members are free to meet, without their decisions having any effect other \nthan as recommendations.\nFrustration with quorum is common. But it also serves an important purpose by preventing a small pro-\nportion of the membership from being burdened with having to decide whether they can legitimately make \nimportant structural decisions, and by preventing them from making decisions that the other members \noppose.

The law requires directors to be at least 18 years old; to not currently be bankrupt; to not \nhave certain intellectual disabilities, notably when they have been \u201cdeclared incapable by a court\u201d; and to \nbe a \u201cnatural person\u201d (in other words, they can\u2019t be an incorporated organization, which the law also consid-\ners to be a person!). But people under 18 years old and people with intellectual disabilities can be directors \nof a non-profit of an organization whose purpose concerns them.  Check your by-laws and constitution \nto see if they set further restrictions. Sometimes, for example, a director must be a member of the orga-\nnization. In the case of federally incorporated non-profits that are soliciting corporations (described in the \nprevious section), at least two directors must be neither officers nor employees of the organization or its \naffiliates.\nNumber of board members. You must elect enough board directors to fill the number specified \nin your constitution. If the articles of incorporation of a federally incorporated non-profit specify a range, \nthen either the membership can fix the specific number of directors by resolution, which remains in effect \nuntil rescinded, or it can delegate this power to the board. In all cases, your organization must have a mini-\nmum of three directors, unless you are a non-soliciting, federally incorporated non-profit, in which case one \nis enough. Provincially incorporated non-profits can't establish a range: the size of the board is always a \nspecific number. A general meeting resolution on its own is also not enough, for a provincially incorporated \norganization, to change the number of seats: it also needs to send notice of the change to the Registraire \ndes entreprises using the proper form. Choosing an odd number of directors is a strategy used to try to \navoid the chance of tie votes.\nReserved seats. It is also possible for the by-laws to reserve a certain number or proportion of seats \non the board of directors for particular categories of people, such as people who benefit from the organiza-\ntion\u2019s services or are active volunteers.\nVoting. Elections of directors of provincially incorporated non-profits must be by ballot, although any \nvacancies that arise during the year can be filled for the rest of that director\u2019s term by the board itself. As \nlong as the board retains quorum, it can fill vacancies even if no directors originally elected by the mem-\nbers remain. But the board can never extend a director\u2019s mandate beyond the one the members initially \nelected them to.\nIf no election is held. If, for whatever reason, an election is not held at your AGM as it should be, \nyour existing directors remain in their positions until a general meeting is called and elections held. This \nensures that even if your AGM doesn\u2019t happen, you\u2019re not left without a board of directors.\nRemoving board members. The rules describing how to remove a board member have to be \noutlined in the by-laws and even this may not be enough for a provincially incorporated non-profit, where \nthey may have to be written in your letters patent. \nSee more on this topic above in Section 4 \u2013 When to have a Special General Meeting (SGM), or in COCo\u2019s \ninfosheet Incorporation of a Non-Profit in Quebec.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3286, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a41b56f0-7a1a-4286-860e-4d5203c02df6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a41b56f0-7a1a-4286-860e-4d5203c02df6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b7490414-67d6-4a4a-810d-2540e603cfa3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\AGM-Legal-Info-Sheet-EN-2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 432341, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "731644da201cadde801226c3ed52f05059e230f4593d96404e017e3859c83f2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "19\nFurther resources & legal notices\nThe following resources provide detailed information on non-profit governance, and are generally available \nto borrow from COCo\u2019s resource library or to purchase from us.
