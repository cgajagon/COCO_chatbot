legal information, not legal advice\n \nThe overarching legal responsibilities of a non-profit Board are to ensure that the organization stays \ntrue to its mission, operates effectively, and acts in

In other organizations, the staff are the key drivers of \nthe organization's activities.  Staff are relied on for a million-and-one things, namely to  keep the \norganization functioning and working towards it's mandate. They coordinate activities, operations, \nplanning, and ensure that work plans or organization objectives are met.\nThis can work in a traditional hierarchical model with an E.D.

That said, it is widely accepted that a board\u2019s primary role is to provide oversight. \nThis means focusing on the long-term health of the organization and maintaining a bird\u2019s-eye view \nof its work and operations, leaving others to tend to the day-to-day responsibilities of program \nimplementation and people coordination. A healthy oversight role typically involves the following \ntasks:\nNurturing a culture in which collaborative leadership, continual learning, and transparency \nare broadly and deeply practiced. The more democratic and engaging an organization \nis, the more sustainable it becomes because the knowledge and skills needed to run the \norganization successfully are shared among many (staff, volunteers, members), rather than \nbeing concentrated in a single person who might leave at any time.\nServing as an unwavering source of support for the staff, while at the same time helping them \nreflect, question, experiment, and surface underlying assumptions.\nProviding oversight to the staff functioning through the hiring, firing and evaluation of the \nExecutive Director\nReviewing quarterly statements and approving the annual budget.\nApproving internal policies.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nSTAFF AND \nBOARD ROLES", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1997, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5efd650-03d5-4805-be0a-034dda7a9364": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5efd650-03d5-4805-be0a-034dda7a9364", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 693818, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2cfe7e53-2a14-4f67-8966-e5a90d67da97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 693818, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "9906ef01585bc676c628302a08cd8c28e7f5eb44ade08056a6bca69140b41f4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "6\nSTAFF AND BOARD ROLES\nRevisiting the organization\u2019s mission, vision, values and approach, in collaboration with staff, \nto ensure that they are still relevant and that the organization\u2019s programming is in harmony \nwith its mission.  \nEngaging in organization-wide evaluations, in collaboration with staff. \nEngaging in strategic thinking and planning, in collaboration with staff.\nMaking sure that there is a strong process in place for making decisions about influencing \npublic policy.\nWhile maintaining a focus on their oversight role, it is quite normal for Boards to  assist with some \naspects of day-to-day operations.

Board decisions can only be made \u2018around the table\u2019\nGovernance of the nonprofit corporation is a collective board responsibility. No individual trustee/\nboard member, not even the president, can make decisions or act in the name of the organization \nunless having been authorized to do so by board resolution. A board member may choose to carry \nout non-board volunteer tasks but does so under the authority of the executive director. \n3.  Honoring Decisions\nBoard members must honor all decisions made collectively by the board. Speaking against decisions \nmade by board members needs to be dealt with immediately (and merits a board discussion and \npolicy). Any board member who does not support a particular board decision or who feels that the \ndecision made is grounds for mismanagement or conflict of interest can ask to have their dissent \nrecorded in the minutes. However, if after democratic debate a board member cannot support and \nhonor the decision, s/he should resign.\n4.  Confidentiality\nIn order to maintain a strong level of trust at all levels of the organization  - board, director, staff and \nmembers \u2013 it is essential that all particulars of a Board meeting are not discussed with others outside \nthe meetings. While the minutes of all board meetings need to be made available to members and \nboard members need to be able to explain the reasons for the decisions, the specifics of the meeting \nshould not be discussed. Neither in the minutes nor in outside discussions should \u201cwho said what \nto whom\u201d be discussed. In the case of sensitive issues (e.g. human resources \u2013 hiring, firing, salaries \nand evaluation) it is extremely important that full confidentiality is kept.

We need to decide whether to move down the street to Jimmy\u2019s \nbasement or pay the extra $200 that the city is asking for.  Stephanie proposes we stay where we \nare and pay the extra $200.  Ahmed seconds the proposal.  \nOr \nAfter discussion on Stephanie\u2019s proposal, a vote was held.  Proposal passed with a vote of 6 to 1. \nNext steps: Charlotte will call the landlord to renew the lease. \nNot so good: \nLease renewal\nThe staff is very upset that the landlord is trying to hike up the rent and get us out of here.  Jimmy \nsays we can move to his basement.  Stephanie has some reservations about that and says that \nJimmy doesn\u2019t clean his house very often. Claire said she didn\u2019t appreciate that comment about \nJimmy\u2019s house. Charlotte will try to call the landlord sometime before next week. Jimmy went out \nto have a cigarette and said he didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. \nThis is not to say that Jimmy\u2019s feelings are not important.  It is simply that writing them into the \nminutes of the organization are not the most appropriate way to deal with them.  Notice that in the \nfirst three examples, next steps are clearly stated.  If we forget what we decided or who was going \nto take action, we can flip through our notes and find out in an instant.  If we have nothing but the \nlast example to go on, we have no idea what will happen next.  No decision has been recorded, \nonly Charlotte\u2019s intention to \u2018try\u2019 something.

Giving money, in addition to time is a great way to help the organization \nmeet its fundraising goals.  \nWrite grants.  Board members skilled in this area who have an excellent sense of the day to \nday working of an organization can help with grant and report writing.  \nRaise money.  Have a dinner party and invite people to donate over coffee and dessert.  In \na band?  Put on a benefit show!  See Kim Klein\u2019s \u201c29 ways for board members to raise $500\u201d \nhttp://www.coco-net.org/docs/29_ways_boards.pdf for more fundraising ideas. \nApprove a resolution.  At a very minimum, board members will be called upon to approve \nof the idea of asking for money.  Resolutions are usually sent to potential funders along with \ngrant applications.\nWhat makes fundraising a perfect task for the board of directors?\nSuccessful fundraising requires a solid understanding of the organization as a whole.  Engaged \nboard members know about the organization, its mandate, goals and objectives and can speak \nabout them with passion! \nFundraising is about relationship building.  Fundraising gives board members an opportunity \nto connect with friends, family, colleagues and other networks about the organization, helping \nbuild the organizations membership base, or more importantly in this case \u2013 its donor base.\nIt can be very satisfying teamwork!  Giving the board a task to own as a team gives them a reason \nto get to know one another through important fundraising work.  Every dollar earned brings a \nsense of accomplishment and satisfaction for the board, and the organization as a whole. \nFundraising is essential to sustainable financial planning.  Financial oversight is one \nresponsibility of the board.  While most boards delegate financial management to the staff, \nraising money is a perfect way to participate in the financial growth and sustainability of the \norganization. \nBOARD \nMEMBERS AND \nFUNDRAISING\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2054, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05451f36-aed7-4c2f-8739-af2c714b261f": {"__data__": {"id_": "05451f36-aed7-4c2f-8739-af2c714b261f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 693818, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06510d26-1d09-48bd-b5b3-0ee5cc6ee28a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 693818, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "cded4572cfd3adea0b81c76f37d627acdddbfbb9bf689281927c70f8c5a91d2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "16\nFundraising requires a cultural shift; the whole organization must be involved.

Such competing interests have the potential to interfere with the person\u2019s ability \nto remain impartial as they fulfill their duties. A conflict of interest exists even if no unethical or \ninappropriate actions are taken.\nSample \u201cconflict of interest\u201d by-laws:\nGeneral Conflict of Interest:  Anyone participating in a decision on behalf of the organization and \nwho has or is perceived to have a financial, personal, or official interest in that decision of such \nnature that it may prevent him/her from acting in an impartial manner is obliged to excuse him/\nherself from the discussion and voting on said item. In the case of the Board, such instances are to \nbe recorded in the meeting minutes.  \nConflict of Interest Relating to Board Remuneration: The directors shall serve without remuneration, \nand no director shall directly or indirectly receive any profit from his position as such, provided that \na director may be paid reasonable expenses incurred by him in the performance of his duties. A \ndirector may, nonetheless, be paid for other service to the Charity, subject the prior approval of the \nBoard with that director abstaining.\nWhat the law says about Board members receiving payment:\nAccording to Articles 324 & 325 of the Quebec Provincial Civil Code, Board members are allowed \nto enter into contracts with the organization. However, such a situation must be made known \nto the Board; recorded in the meeting minutes; and approved by the Board, with the Board \nmember in question abstaining from the discussion and voting.\nAccording to Federal Common Law- Chapter 2 of the Corporate and Insolvency Law Policy,  the \nfederal court has always ruled against Board members receiving paid contracts from nonprofit \norganizations. However, the court also considers local context in its ruling and, in the case of \nQuebec, respects the Quebec Provincial Civil Code.\nAccording to Revenue Canada, the above sample by-law is sufficient for auditing purposes. However, \nthey did recommend that organizations add a \u201cconflict of interest statement\u201d to their by-laws. \n \nCONFLICT \nOF INTEREST\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2279, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55d29a24-38ca-4e8e-a99d-fb2d81ea66b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "55d29a24-38ca-4e8e-a99d-fb2d81ea66b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 693818, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f256ffd-f65e-412f-85fc-6c41cffcc86f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_path": "data\\prod\\docs\\COCo-BoardOfDirectors-3-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 693818, "creation_date": "2025-01-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-27"}, "hash": "31ea87a37e9ed3c81026d1928ce5bc7fb5651d71e0b207952df3127c468427f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "20\nSAMPLE BOARD SELF-ASSESMENT\nSAMPLE BOARD SELF-ASSESSMENT\n RATING 1 -
